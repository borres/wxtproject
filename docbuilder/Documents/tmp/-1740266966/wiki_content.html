While there is a welcome recognition of the potential inherent in rigorous and good quality qualitative approaches to research, the know-how pertaining to the why and how has not been as widely disseminated as it could be. This manual is a small contribution to redress this imbalance and to aid greater collaboration amongst qualitative researchers. It provides a wide range of materials that might be of use in intensive training programmes, encouraging a critical engagement with key issues as well as the development of basic research skills.  </p><p>The manual is an outcome of a research partnership (<a href="http://recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/" title=" RECOUP"> RECOUP</a>) involving institutions of the South and the North. Our partnership not only demanded a range of research skills, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, but it also brought together people from varied disciplines, where it became crucial to foster a shared understanding, not only of how to do research, but also around what we meant by research itself. This manual presents a snapshot of how we developed a programme that enabled all of us to engage in a useful dialogue (and indeed practice various skills) about qualitative research. It formed the backbone of workshops that were organised in India, Kenya, Ghana and Pakistan, and then again in India. What is presented here might seem straightforward: but the reality is far from this. Each workshop helped us evolve this manual in different ways and it has changed considerably from the original – we hope for the better. The spirit of dialogue, experimentation and a belief in the value of qualitative research that we developed during the process of refining the manual underpins our desire to share this work. We do not believe the process is over now that the manual is on the web: we hope everyone who reads and uses this material will tell us how it went, and engage with us and other users to adapt and improve it.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Who can use this manual? </span></h2><p>This manual is designed to assist facilitators, with some level of experience of teaching and practice of qualitative research, to train others to conduct qualitative research, for example:</p><ul><li><p> academicians in the Global South who may wish to train graduate students </p></li><li><p> researchers who would like to train people working in local NGOs, who are now more commonly becoming involved in research</p></li><li><p> people working in international organisations who may wish to train their staff members to undertake or commission qualitative research in Southern contexts. </p></li></ul><p>The skills developed through this approach would be of benefit even for evaluation of programmes, a task commonly undertaken by many agencies. </p><p>Ideally, participants should already have some background knowledge of qualitative research. Some participants might have hands-on experience, but more may have a rudimentary knowledge of the theory of qualitative research, often without any practical experience. Facilitators might consider providing people in the former category with some basic readings as preparation for the workshop (though the manual is designed to be as user-friendly as possible for people with very little academic background in social research). In some places we have also assumed that participants may have had more experience, or have more understanding, of carrying out household surveys or analysing quantitative research projects: one of our underlying principles has been to find ways of helping such participants ‘unlearn’ techniques that are better suited to quantitative methods (such as following a questionnaire without deviation) than to qualitative methods. </p><p>It is, however, essential for the facilitator to have knowledge and experience of undertaking qualitative research: the more often that facilitators can refer to practical examples from their own experience, the better. It is also highly desirable for two or more people to act as facilitators: though one of the authors of this manual has led a workshop on his own, it was exhausting and not as good for the participants as those workshops in which two or three people shared the presentations and assisted with small group work and provided feedback.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestions on how to use the manual  </span></h2><p>This manual can be used as it is to run a training programme, but we would encourage you not to use it as a “prescription”. We hope that you will adjust the manual (for example, by changing the number of days, or the suggested readings) to suit the needs of your particular situations. An important issue to flag here is that the manual should be used by the facilitator and NOT the participants. It is not designed to be a stand-alone text to be given to the participants for them to use on their own: we believe strongly that much of the benefit of using our approach comes from people learning together, and undertaking practical exercises and small-group work to reinforce the messages and help to develop the necessary skills. </p><p>Throughout the manual we are encouraging a very interactive and engaged learning style, driven by a focus on ‘learning by doing’. Many sessions involve brain-storming, or small-group work, and we recommend keeping the number of sessions involving a didactic, lecture style, to the minimum. But do experiment with alternative activity-based teaching methods if you are happier with them, if they suit your participants better, or you just think they will work better. In keeping with this approach, we have put in place a 7 day programme which involves a range of activities, including, for example, conducting practice interviews, a fieldwork observation exercise, and some hands-on experiences of coding. These activities range from working in a one-to-one scenario, conducting small group tasks, and working in a whole-group setting. Each session is prefaced with a list of things that will help you to run the session (for example: flip charts, audio recorders). We have also included a list of readings that will support you, and some readings which might be useful to share with the participants. Once again, if you’d rather use a computer and projector to record the responses of participants elicited by brainstorming, instead of a flip chart, blackboard or whiteboard, we would encourage you to try this out – it has sometimes worked for us.</p><p>As noted earlier, the activities involve a lot of engagement with the participants, and the facilitator’s role is to encourage discussions. The sessions which worked well for us are the ones when the participants got engaged and really spent time making sense of the activities, and we think time is necessary to let the issues sink in, so don’t try to rush things! In order to support some of this interaction we have, at various places, provided a list of responses generated at our various workshops, which can be useful supplements to your own discussions. These are not the only possible responses, and are provided to give you a sense of the range of likely ones – and to help you prepare for how to respond if similar responses come up in the sessions you run.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Open Educational Resources and Creative Commons </span></h2><p>This is an `open access' work: an Open Educational Resource or Open CourseWare.

We do not believe that these sessions, by themselves, will be sufficient to shape good qualitative researchers. Rather, we hope to support some initial steps towards participants considering, learning and engaging with the processes that are essential for good qualitative research. The skills being developed in courses run with the help of this manual require further practice, reflection and updating.</p></li><li><p> Despite hosting this manual on the internet, we are not assuming that the only people who will find this useful and are likely to be interested will have access to the internet. We would encourage you to share these materials with other colleagues who might find them useful. As mentioned above, printable versions of the material are available from this website. We strive to find the most accessible ways of sharing this information and any thoughts from you on how best to do this will be very welcome. </p></li><li><p> In no way do we think that we have covered all the important issues in qualitative research. We are fully aware of the fact that we have engaged with only some of the central skills and a whole world of research methods and other issues still remain unaddressed. So we cannot stress strongly enough how much we would welcome feedback on any points which you feel “should” be included in any basic course engaging with qualitative research -- and session plans, handouts, PowerPoints and so on to help make these suggestions a reality. We would also welcome information on how the manual worked for you – the changes that you made or did not make; how easy or complicated the handouts were; any essential readings that would be useful to share with others. And if you decide eventually not to use the materials for some reason, do let us know: all feedback will be incredibly valuable. Hosting it on the web as an Open Educational Resource will hopefully make this task much simpler, and we hope to develop a community of qualitative research practice that will be much more stimulating, rewarding and interactive than is possible through the use of other media. </p></li></ul><p>As a final note, we repeat: we see this manual as a starting point, not a final product. We know we have not addressed many key philosophical issues that many people (ourselves included) believe should be thoroughly discussed before a researcher goes into the field: but such discussions can be found elsewhere and we do not want to replicate these excellent resources. We believe that training courses based on this manual have the ability to lay strong foundations for people to go on to become good qualitative researchers, even though the manual addresses only a limited range of issues. We hope that you will be inspired to use it, and with your ingenuity adapt and improve it.</p><p><a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nidhi" title="Nidhi Singal">Nidhi Singal</a>, University of Cambridge</p><p><a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=User:Roger" title="Roger Jeffery">Roger Jeffery</a>, University of Edinburgh</p><h1 class="firstHeading">Overview</h1><h2><span class="mw-headline">Basics </span></h2><p>This manual has been designed to help facilitators run workshops with small groups (between 10 and 16 participants). We think this size is ideal: it is not so small that there's no opportunity for mutual learning, nor so large that it is hard for every participant to make contributions to discussions. In addition, in some sessions (Semi-structured interviews, Ethnographic fieldwork, for example) facilitators should give individual feedback to participants, for example on interviewing styles and on fieldnote writing styles. This means that there should be at least two facilitators who are familiar with the whole course (though they do not necessarily have to attend every session). In our experience, we found the presence of three or four facilitators was better than relying on only two. </p><p>Try to find a room that can easily accommodate all the participants in a circular or U-shaped configuration. We would strongly discourage a lecture style lay out. It would be useful to have spaces (small rooms, or simply open spaces or various corners in a bigger room) that can allow for ‘break out’ discussions. These break-out spaces would ideally be used to help participants to work on a task in smaller sub-groups.</p><p>Most sessions will benefit from a flip-chart, or failing that a blackboard or a whiteboard (with good clear pens) as well as a computer and data projector and white screen. If you can also tear off flip-chart pages and put them up around the room for the duration of the workshop, that will help to reinforce some messages. </p><p>This manual has been designed to support a 7-day workshop, with multiple sessions suggested for each day (even then at times we found ourselves ‘rushing’ through things). Depending on your needs and circumstances, the workshop might be best timetabled with some “time off” for the participants to move into the ‘real world’ to try out some of the skills that have been discussed in the sessions. For example, a whole day would be needed for a fieldwork task to be carried out, for notes to be written up and made available for discussion. In such a scenario, the task could be done over Saturday, notes etc written over Sat-Sun., which would then be available for discussion on the Monday. Another way of running the training might be on the basis of one day a week, over about 2 months. </p><p>Below we suggest a particular structure for a 7-day workshop, but we would encourage you to experiment with different sequences. We think that the sessions on 'Getting Started' and 'Qualitative Research' must come at the beginning, and the session on evaluation obviously comes at the end (though, in this session we have also suggested some daily evaluation activities you might like to run, so it is worth considering this session as you are planning your workshop). The intervening sessions of the workshop could be combined in different ways. You may also wish to leave out some sessions, to give others more or less time than we suggest, or introduce new topics and sessions of your own. </p><p>All the information that we have provided in this manual is open access and we encourage you to use and adapt these materials in ways that you think are most beneficial for the needs of your team/participants. We would however encourage you to share with us the kind of adaptations you have made, things you found useful or not so useful. Your experiences will contribute immensely to better learning for all the others who are engaged in similar efforts.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Sample Timetable </span></h2><p>This sample timetable is also available on <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Overview/Overview_Handout" title="Overview Handout">Overview Handout</a>:</p><h1 class="firstHeading">Getting started</h1><h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction and overview of the workshop </span></h2><img src="Pictures/12221243799333150720.jpe" class="image" title="" alt=""/><img src="Pictures/12221243799360471040.jpe" class="image" title="" alt=""/><img src="Pictures/12221243799386570752.jpe" class="image" title="" alt=""/><img src="Pictures/12221243799412629504.jpe" class="image" title="" alt=""/><p>Time: 15-30 minutes</p><p>Objective: To introduce the aims of the workshop.</p><p>Preparation: Try to ensure the setting is egalitarian, all sitting round a common space (board room style, and not a lecture style). </p><p>Process:  Led by the workshop facilitator, start with a ‘getting to know you’ exercise, especially if people are not already familiar with each other.</p><p>Introduce participants to the aims of the workshop, which can be broadly summed up as: </p><ul><li><p> to develop a shared understanding of research using qualitative methods.</p></li><li><p> to provide an opportunity to critically discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches to qualitative data collection.</p></li><li><p> to provide an opportunity to experience the use of qualitative research methods, both for participants with a ‘book knowledge’ of these methods and for those with more experience with the use of quantitative methods.</p></li></ul><p>Once the participants are familiar with each other and are aware of the broad aims of the workshop, provide participants with an overview of what will happen over the next few days: circulate the first handout (hand out: Overview of the workshop).</p><p>Talk the participants through the handout and highlight the following:</p><ul><li><p> Acknowledge the research experience there may already be in the room and stress the need to learn together, to actively engage with others and to build on existing knowledge and experiences. Hence stress that all sessions must have a strong element of participation if they are to work properly.</p></li><li><p> Point out that this training programme provides an opportunity to practice various skills, not only within sessions but also tasks outside of the sessions that have been scripted. Engaging with workshop activities is essential as all sessions are heavily interlinked. Ask that everyone who attends takes part in all the activities. As the facilitator, make sure that no-one should sit around and watch while others do things (like role-playing in interviews) that might be embarrassing.</p></li><li><p> Recognise that there are lots of things that participants will be discussing and covering over the next few days. In order to make this task easier, a range of handouts and additional reading materials will be provided.</p></li><li><p> Encourage participants to take notes in a 'course diary'. This will help them to reflect about the sessions, and note down any questions and contributions that they wish to discuss.</p></li></ul><h2><span class="mw-headline">Working towards shared goals  </span></h2><img src="Pictures/12221243799468519424.jpe" class="image" title="" alt=""/><img src="Pictures/12221243799494531072.jpe" class="image" title="" alt=""/><p>Time: 15-30 minutes </p><p>Objectives: To become aware of the different expectations that participants have from this workshop</p><p>Preparation: Packs of ‘Post-its’</p><p>Process: Explain that you want to find out more about the participants' expectations, feelings and thoughts about the workshop, and to share with them your feelings, thoughts and expectations, so that you can make sure during the next few days of the workshop you can respond most effectively to what the participants want/need.  </p><p>Ask participants to write what they expect from the next few days. Each aim/expectation should be written on a single 'Post-it' (or use index cards and thumb-tacks). Ask participants to stick their aims/expectations on the board. </p><p>Allow time for questions and comments.

Guidelines can help people to work better together, in a way that is fair and respectful to everyone's needs and contributions. Guidelines can help everyone feel comfortable in a group which is essential for successful learning.</p><p>Divide participants into small groups of three or four, and ask them to make a list of all the things they think should be included in the guidelines.</p><p>After 10 minutes bring everyone back together, and ask each small group in turn to share their suggestions.</p><p>Write their suggestions on flip chart.

The following areas should be discussed in separate sub-sessions, each of which might take 15-20 minutes: </p><h3><span class="mw-headline">What is involved in community scoping?</span></h3><p>Brainstorm on things to be done to find out, relatively quickly, the important features of a community. (10 minutes)</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">When is community scoping an appropriate activity?</span></h3><p>This is not necessarily something for all projects: when might it be useful? Discuss in whole group (15 minutes)</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">How should consent and access through 'gatekeepers' be negotiated?</span></h3><p>Brainstorm about what kinds of gatekeepers are likely to be encountered in the particular settings; how to approach them to maximise access; how to avoid being identified with the interests of the gatekeepers or to be limited just to what they want you to do (15 minutes)</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">What participatory approaches (for example, map-making, transect walks, wealth ranking) are suitable for a scoping exercise?</span></h3><p>Ask participants to share their experience of using participatory approaches. Try to get as complete a list as possible, and then consider the strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of method. It may be possible to carry out an exercise using one or two of these methods (for example, a ranking exercise; daily timelines) (15-30 minutes)</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">What are the main roles of a household census?</span></h3><p>Brainstorm on factors to consider in deciding to carry out a census or other ways of collecting reliable data on households: the size of the community, the resources available, and the purposes of the research (what would you use a census for?) (10 minutes)</p><p>Introduce the sample census form (as a handout or as an overhead slide); explain the context. In groups of 3 or 4, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this example (10 minutes) and report back to the full group (10 minutes)</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">What are the main issues in planning the process of community scoping?</span></h3><p>Community scoping can be done as a routine task, in which case it is likely to be done poorly (with little detail or understanding of community processes). Such an approach may lead to further difficulties for researchers in that community. Brainstorm on the factors that are involved in a ‘good’ scoping exercise (10 minutes) Notes: community scoping should be seen as part of the opening of a positive relationship with members of the community; and it can be very revealing of community dynamics if the experience of scoping is documented properly.</p><p>Facilitator's Notes: The main points to get across</p><ul><li><p> The importance of establishing egalitarian relationships at the start of the research process, such as being willing to answer personal questions as well as questions about the research – especially if the research involves the poor</p></li><li><p> The value of walking around and being seen by as many people as possible</p></li><li><p> The issues generated by getting permission from ‘gate-keepers’ as well as participants</p></li><li><p> The opportunities to use ‘participatory’ methods as well as semi-structured interviews to collect basic general community-level data</p></li><li><p> The potential of carrying out a simple census exercise</p></li></ul><p>Community scoping is often an integral part of ethnographic fieldwork, which we elaborate upon in the session on <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Ethnographic_fieldwork&amp;oldid=1249" title="Ethnographic fieldwork">Ethnographic fieldwork</a>.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Resources and references</span></h2><p>The general field of participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods has been developed since 1990, and there is a very large literature and many resources.

This is about writing (in some senses, more than about ‘participating’ or ‘observing’): there is no point in observing if the observations remain locked up in the heads of the researchers. Therefore, the session is designed to lead up to a fieldwork exercise in which participants do some observation (in as participatory a way as is possible, given local constraints), to write fieldnotes, to share them with the facilitators and the rest of the group, and to engage in some positive reflection on their own and others’ writing styles.

They should have reflected on important social and cultural norms that researchers must be sensitive to in the field.</p><p>By the end of the section, workshop participants should: </p><ul><li><p> be aware of the main methodological issues raised by ethnographic fieldwork</p></li><li><p> be able to reflect on their own conduct in recording informal conversations in everyday life, and be able to assess critically other pieces of research carried out in this tradition</p></li><li><p> be aware of the main ethical and theoretical issues raised by this research method.</p></li></ul><p>Preparation:</p><ul><li><p> A <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Presentation_on_ethnographic_fieldwork" title="Presentation on ethnographic fieldwork">Presentation on ethnographic fieldwork</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800784531456.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> is available to be used or amended if desired</p></li><li><p> Examples of appropriate fieldnotes from your own research or some other appropriate project should be available (preferably 1-2 pages of two or three different styles of fieldnotes).</p></li><li><p> A <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Handout_on_note-taking_during_fieldwork_and_interviews" title="Handout on note-taking during fieldwork and interviews">Handout on note-taking during fieldwork and interviews</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800792760320.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> is available, which outlines the different types of note-taking</p></li><li><p> Flip chart and big markers (OR use someone sitting at a computer and typing in points raised so that they are shown on a projector)</p></li></ul><p>Process:</p><ul><li><p> Mixture of didactic (PowerPoint) and brainstorming activities, either in small groups or with the whole group.

This raises the more general issues of ‘for whom’ fieldnotes are written. </p></li><li><p> The ethical issues raised by fieldwork will also inevitably be raised by participants: decide whether you want to go into these in detail during this session, or address them in a dedicated session on ethics.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p> The fieldworker is the research instrument: what does this mean for issues of replicability and reliability?

What to do about reactivity, leading questions, the use of background information, confidentiality. </p></li><li><p> What to do about encouraging informal ‘focus groups’ in the field: how and what to record.</p></li><li><p> Feedback to the community at the end: who can see what? Who should see what?</p></li></ul><p>Topics to be covered (not necessarily in this order):</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Preparation for field visit</span></h2><p>Time: 30 minutes</p><p>Objectives:</p><p>By the end of the field visit and follow-up period to write fieldnotes, participants should </p><ul><li><p> understand what is involved in ‘participating in order to write’ and how this differs from everyday life</p></li><li><p> have experience of writing quick ‘head notes’ to use as memory jogs for writing fieldnotes</p></li><li><p> have begun to apply the lessons from the previous session about what kinds of things to record and how to record them</p></li><li><p> have begun to reflect on the choices they have made in their writing styles</p></li><li><p> be ready to contribute to a discussion of their own and other people’s fieldnotes. </p></li></ul><p>Process:</p><p>It is not always easy to think of an appropriate setting in which course participants can be asked to carry out a short observational exercise. If you are running this course on a ‘one day per week’ basis, there would be time to ask participants to select their own site, arrange entry, deal with issues of consent and so on. In a course run over 6-8 consecutive days, it may be unreasonable to ask the participants to set this up. If the facilitators do have access to a site where these minimal requirements can be met, this can be considered. An alternative option is to use an initial visit to the place where research is planned, and to get course participants to write up what they have observed and heard in the visit.</p><p>Otherwise, the site for practice observational work must be one where public access is unrestricted, and yet course participants can do more than just observe people from a distance. Ideally, it should be possible to hear conversations, to speak to people at the site without unduly misleading them as to your purposes, and to find a range of activities to observe. There are two options we have used:</p><ul><li><p>Ask all participants to visit a similar kind of setting, not necessarily the same examples. Two relatively successful sites we have used have been busy up-market shopping centres, and local temples. This helps with the feedback session, since all participants can be given the same orientation and research question. You might like to consider the example handout for the shopping-centre fieldwork task (<a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Fieldwork_Tasksheet_1" title="Fieldwork Tasksheet 1">Fieldwork Tasksheet 1</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800857561088.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/>) and the example handout for the place of worship fieldwork task (<a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Fieldwork_Tasksheet_2" title="Fieldwork Tasksheet 2">Fieldwork Tasksheet 2</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800863690752.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/>).</p></li><li><p>Allow participants to use their own initiative and select a site they have access to for personal reasons. The advantage of this is that it allows participants to fit the observational exercise into what may be busy personal lives, and makes it more likely that they will have to report on conversations they have been part of. The disadvantage is that you may find it hard to come up with sensible common research questions. Participants often do not realise (until after the event) how different ‘observing in order to write’ is from carrying out one’s routine daily lives – but this is a good lesson to learn!</p></li></ul><p>In either case, participants need clear instructions about what to do, whether you want them to take notes at the time, how long they should spend at the site, and so on. Handouts explaining the task should be adapted to suit your own purposes before being given out, or used as part of a PowerPoint presentation to explain the task.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Feedback after field visit</span></h2><p>It is relatively easy to get people to do a piece of fieldwork observation in a public space. It is much harder to get them to write about it in ways that are clear, revealing, and available for themselves (and, in group projects, to others). Good fieldwork writing is essential in order to understand and analyse well after the event. This is a crucial session, and may take quite a lot of planning and quite a long time to run, depending on the number of participants. </p><p>Time: 90 minutes </p><p>Objectives:</p><p>By the end of this session, participants should</p><ul><li><p> have discussed real-life examples of different ways of writing fieldnotes</p></li><li><p> have received some feedback on their own efforts, both from other course participants and from the course facilitator</p></li><li><p> have a clear idea of how they might be able to improve their fieldwork techniques through further experience and reflection</p></li></ul><p>Preparation:</p><p>It is best if the example fieldnotes are available to the facilitators 3-4 hours before the feedback session. This gives the facilitators time to read through the notes and take extracts for use in the feedback session – as examples of different styles, good practice and so on.</p><p>If resources permit, make at least one copy of each set of fieldnotes; facilitators can then keep one complete set. You can use the other copy for discussion in small groups (3-4 participants). The members of each group should pass around the copy of their own notes to the other members to read, and then to have a structured discussion. </p><p>Process</p><p>If possible, set the fieldwork task immediately before a break (for example, a weekend) and ask participants to write their notes during their day off: it should take 2-3 hours to write (or even better, to type up) notes from a fieldtrip of 1-2 hours. Participants should provide their brief head-notes as well as the written up versions.</p><p>It is very important that people do not criticise in a negative way, but focus on the positive aspects. It is also essential that no-one takes part in these discussions unless they have also taken part in the fieldwork exercise and have fieldnotes to share: many participants will feel very vulnerable in sharing their writing in this way, and they are reassured if they know that everyone else is in the same boat. In the same spirit, the facilitators should make available some of their own fieldnotes for comparison. </p><p>There is a <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Presentation_on_Reporting_Back" title="Presentation on Reporting Back">Presentation on Reporting Back</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800895729664.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> that provides an example of how we have worked through the materials that were produced after an exercise in which the course participants visited temples, in pairs, and wrote accounts of what they observed. The first slide is a list of the kinds of things that were generated from the feedback from the small-group discussions, as people reflected on their own and others’ writing; the remaining slides were created at short notice from the examples provided to the facilitators.</p><p>There is also a document of <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/notes_towards_running_a_feedback_session" title="notes towards running a feedback session">notes towards running a feedback session</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800902670336.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> that shows the kinds of topics that can be raised in a feedback session on the exercise visiting shopping centres, which uses examples from the fieldnotes produced by the course participants to stimulate discussion.</p><h1 class="firstHeading">Transcription &amp; translation</h1><h2><span class="mw-headline">Issues around transcribing data</span></h2><p>Transcribing Issues</p><p>Many projects will need to decide what to do with recorded interviews or focus-group discussions. Should interviews be transcribed in the full sense (that is, to provide an as accurate as possible, word-for-word written equivalent of the recording)? If so, should the whole interview be transcribed? These questions raise important issues. Some of the issues are technical; others have to do with translation; others have to do with resources; and others depend heavily on the purposes of the research. See the <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/handout_on_transcribing_issues" title="handout on transcribing issues">handout on transcribing issues</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800918980608.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> for more discussion on this.</p><p>Time: 30-45 minutes</p><p>Objectives:</p><ul><li><p> to clarify the meanings of ‘note-taking’ and ‘transcription’ through a worked example</p></li><li><p> to help participants plan their data collections and research design in the knowledge of the issues of equipment, soft-ware, translation, costs and purposes that will arise in the management of recorded data</p></li></ul><p>Preparation:</p><p>If you have a data projector and computer, add a pair of loudspeakers to make sure that participants can hear the audio clip. Otherwise you may need to copy the clip onto a CD to play in a CD-player.</p><p>Process:</p><p>Open the <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/handout_on_three_versions_of_accounts_of_the_interview" title="handout on three versions of accounts of the interview">handout on three versions of accounts of the interview</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800938758144.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> on your computer so that participants can hear the interview and read each version in turn. Alternatively, prepare the three versions as a handout, to be given to participants before they listen to the clip. </p><p>The <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/interview" title="4-minute audio clip">4-minute audio clip</a> is from an interview of SS by RJ, as part of a project on pharmaceuticals that includes attempts to understand how drugs are used by medical personnel who attend women who give birth in their own homes in rural north India. You might want to play this clip (or parts of it) three times while showing the different levels of report and transcription. This will probably generate a lively discussion. If you want to take the opportunity to make decisions about your own project, the discussion might need 30 minutes; otherwise, 15 minutes might be sufficient.</p><p>Note the use of italics for the interviewer’s contributions; and the occasional insertion of the time in the interview (so that researchers can go back and listen again if they want to check on the accuracy of the transcription).</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Issues around translation of data</span></h2><p>All social research involves translation, if only from the ‘language of the streets’ into formal academic prose, but more issues arise if the data collection is in a different language from the language in which the results are analysed or reported. In many qualitative social research projects in the South, researchers carry out data collection in their native language, or in another local language, and record field-notes (or responses to interview questions) in either English or (in some cases) in yet a further language. </p><p>Note: For the sake of simplicity, in what follows we assume that the language of analysis will be English. If you will be working in some other language, please change to suit your local circumstances. </p><p>Time: 30 or 45 minutes</p><p>Objectives:</p><ul><li><p> To make participants aware of key issues with respect to the trade off between getting almost exact translations of individual words or phrases, on the one hand, and conveying the full sense of the clause, sentence of paragraph, on the other</p></li><li><p> To make participants aware of the importance of careful thought about who should translate what parts of the research fieldnotes and transcripts, when this should be done, and with what kinds of quality controls</p></li><li><p> (If this training takes place near the beginning of a research project) To help develop routines to ensure adapt these general considerations to the specific requirements of a particular project</p></li></ul><p>Preparation:</p><p>Provide a short extract from an interview or focus group discussion transcript (or recording) in a language (other than English) understood by all participants. The extract should include some sections where translation is not straightforward, and should be provided either as a handout or as an overhead slide.</p><p>Process:</p><ul><li><p>Start by asking participants about their own experiences of translation, and move into an individual or small group exercise in which all attempt a translation of the extract. (15 minutes)</p></li><li><p> Facilitate a whole-group discussion of the results (15 minutes)</p></li><li><p> If appropriate, facilitate a whole group discussion of procedures to be adopted in a particular project (15 minutes)</p></li></ul><p>There is a <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/handout_on_issues_of_translation" title="handout on issues of translation">handout on issues of translation</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243800972308480.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> which could be given out after the session.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">References</span></h2><p>References for Transcribing Data</p><p>Gibbs, G.

Ethnographic evidence from studies of identity, social support and wellbeing among Glasgow Punjabis suggests that the complex and strategic blending and switching of vocabulary, tone and accent is one means through which identities and support networks are negotiated and affirmed.

Young (2004). Qualitative Research and Translation Dilemmas. Qualitative Research 4(2): 161-178.</p><p>Author’s Abstract: The focus of this article is an examination of translation dilemmas in qualitative research. Specifically it explores three questions: whether methodologically it   matters if the act of translation is identified or not; the epistemological implications of who does translation; and the consequences for the final product of   how far the researcher chooses to involve a translator in research. Some of the ways in which researchers have tackled language difference are discussed. The medium of spoken and written language is itself critically challenged by considering the implications of similar ‘problems of method’ but in situations   where the translation and interpretation issues are those associated with a visual spatial medium, in this case Sign Language. The authors argue that centring translation and how it is dealt with raises issues of representation that should be of concern to all researchers.</p><h1 class="firstHeading">Using photography</h1><h2><span class="mw-headline">Introducing photographs in research</span></h2><p><p><img src="Pictures/12221243801124100096.jpe" class="image" title="" alt=""/>researcher photograph of a school in Kenya</p>Time: 40 minutes</p><p>Objectives:</p><ul><li><p> To provide a general introduction to the use of photography in research </p></li><li><p> To assist researchers in recognising appropriate opportunities for the use of photography in research</p></li></ul><p>Preparation:</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Presentation_1_on_visual_images_in_research" title="Presentation 1 on visual images in research">Presentation 1 on visual images in research</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801146460160.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/></p></li><li><p> Flip chart</p></li><li><p><a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Born_into_Brothels" title="Born into Brothels">Born into Brothels</a> video clip</p></li></ul><p>Process:</p><p>Begin by asking the participants the various reasons for using photographs in research. Brainstorm these as a big group and write all the reasons on a flip chart so that everyone can see them.</p><p>Leading on from these discussions, introduce participants to the three main ways in which photography can been used in research. You can use the <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Presentation_1_on_visual_images_in_research" title="Presentation 1 on visual images in research">Presentation 1 on visual images in research</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801160540160.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> to further illustrate these points:</p><ul><li><p>Researcher photography: when researchers take photographs to capture contexts, as the research text itself, or in order to later write thick description. Photographs that the researcher takes acts as an aid memoire, allowing for later description and analysis not possible in real time. The examples provided in the powerpoint are images that were captured by the RECOUP researchers when undertaking a field trip in the partner countries. </p></li><li><p>Photoelicitation: where photographs or images are used as elicitation materials in the course of an interview. Photoelicitation acts as a stimulus or trigger to discussing topics that a simple verbal question might not uncover. Photographs may have been generated by the researcher, research participants or from printed or electronic media. Example provided in the powerpoint is a collage of images taken from popular magazines used by a researcher to discuss notions of love. </p></li><li><p>Autophotography (also called photovoice): when research participants are asked to take photographs of a phenomenon. Autophotography is usually accompanied by the research participants' commentaries on their photographs, which is recorded and transcribed, prior to analysis. A very useful example of this approach is illustrated in the video clip provided for this session, Born into Brothels.</p></li></ul><h3><span class="mw-headline">Introduce Born into Brothels to the participants </span></h3><p>Born into Brothels is a documentary about Zana Briski’s use of photography in the red light district of Calcutta (India).

Some aspects of these discussions can be supported by the use of the attached <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Presentation_2_on_visual_images_in_research" title="Presentation 2 on visual images in research">Presentation 2 on visual images in research</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801235781632.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/></p><h3><span class="mw-headline">Clear indication of the usefulness of photographs in your research focus </span></h3><p>It is important to be clear about the research questions/topic that you would like to base your photographic exploration around. It is important to state it in a clear and an unambiguous manner. Even though analysis happens after the data collection, it is important to begin with a clear idea about how these will be analysed. There are many different ways in which images could be analysed – the content of photographs, the quantities of specific artefacts produced or the proportion of people who produce photographs about various themes or indeed what has not been represented. </p><p>An approach that is greatly recommended where research participants take pictures is to conduct a one-to-one discussion with them to make sense of the pictures they have clicked. Why they have clicked? What does it mean to them? What is important in it? These discussions can be recorded and transcribed or one can rely on good note taking.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">Choosing the type of camera</span></h3><p>You need to make decisions about what kind of camera will you use - digital cameras, or conventional film cameras, or even disposable camera. Deciding on either one has important implications in terms of costs, feasibility to develop the pictures and storage issues. Some researchers have also argued about the ethical dimension of using one type over the other.  </p><p>Explain clearly the functions in the camera. As a researcher using a camera you need to be clear about its functions. If handing over the camera to the participants then you need to spend time explaining them how to use it. You need to make sure that they are comfortable about using the camera.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">Ethical issues around using photography in research</span></h3><p>Despite its growing use, and the powerful data it produces, the use of photography in research is not without ethical  and paradigmatic challenges (Emmison &amp; Smith, 2000; Harper, 2000; Ziller, 1990). These challenges are best articulated as a series of questions relating to each of the three types of photography useful in research.</p><ul><li><p>When researchers take photographs in the field:</p><ul><li><p> How do they position themselves? </p></li><li><p> How might this affect the research process? </p></li><li><p> What distinguishes the researcher from a tourist? </p></li><li><p> How do young people respond to being photographed?</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>When photographs are used to elicit data:</p><ul><li><p> How might this affect the results of research?</p></li><li><p> Introduce new knowledge?</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>When participants engage in autophotographic activities:</p><ul><li><p> How might participants who take photography’s in their communities be perceived? </p></li><li><p> What might be the risk to which they are exposed?</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>In addition to some of these questions, other ethical issues remain such as:</p><ul><li><p> how anonymity might be ensured; </p></li><li><p> the issue of ownership of visual materials and subsequent publication); </p></li><li><p> depiction of dangerous and/or illegal activities and the challenges of representation. </p></li></ul></li></ul><p>On the issue of how young people’s lives are represented by researchers, especially those in developing countries, Alam (1994) draws attention to the many ways in which the developing world is portrayed, often by Westerners rather than local researchers or journalists. She warns about how images have been used to construct stereotypes  and one-dimensional pictures of the lived realities of people living in contexts of poverty.

Indeed, a common difficulty faced by new researchers is that they return from data collection and have little idea of what to do next; and when they do decide on a plan for analysis, they discover that they do not have all the material they need or have too much material which is of little relevance to the project.</p><p>Time:</p><p>If you want to address all three objectives outlined below, we suggest a whole day in total for this session. If you focus on the first two objectives and restrict yourself to general principles, you could manage with a long half-day.</p><p>Objectives of the Session:</p><p>The purpose of this session is to discuss three main topics:</p><ul><li><p> ‘Basic housekeeping’: how qualitative data should be stored, managed and distributed</p></li><li><p> The essentials of qualitative data analysis</p></li><li><p> The strengths and challenges of using a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) package to help code and access qualitative data. </p></li></ul><p>Approaches to the Session</p><p>How you deal with the first objective depends on the kind of workshop you are running:</p><ul><li><p> If this is the beginning of a project, or if you want to run this session after a few interviews in such a project have been carried out, then you might want to use this opportunity to go into the details of your project and begin to take decisions. Or,</p></li><li><p> If this is a general training session, and your groups includes solo researchers as well as people likely to work in teams, you might want to discuss the general principles and encourage people to share their ideas of how they will resolve basic management issues in future large projects, PhD or other degree projects etc. </p></li></ul><p>The second objective is crucial: we would expect you to include a session of this kind in any course.</p><p>How you deal with the third objective again depends both on your participants and on local constraints:</p><ul><li><p> If you already have purchased or have access to a specific CAQDAS program, then you might move directly to orientation with respect to that program; alternatively, you might want to reserve most of this material to a time nearer when the analysis will actually take place (because people rapidly forget how to carry out basic tasks in a new program, unless they get quite a lot of hands-on practice immediately).</p></li><li><p> If your group expects to use a CAQDAS package, but has not yet decided which one, or has not yet got access to the package, you might restrict your discussion to a general overview, and offer some advice on choosing a package for those who have yet to make their minds up.</p></li><li><p> If there is little prospect of people having access to a CAQDAS package in the near future, or if you do not feel that it is appropriate to use such a package, then you might be better to focus only on the first two objectives. Managing a small project without using a CAQDAS package may make most sense; but the larger the project, the more difficult data management without a package becomes.</p></li></ul><h2><span class="mw-headline">Management of data</span></h2><p>Time: 30-60 minutes</p><p>Preparation:  This depends on whether you are training a group of researchers in an existing project or not. If so, you should have start with your own ideas about managing the data you collect. But you’ll certainly need a flip-chart, black- or white-board or computer plus projector for the brainstorm sessions.</p><p>Process:</p><ul><li><p>Small groups (2-3 people in each) to come up with three issues that need to be considered when thinking about the management of data (10 minutes)</p></li><li><p>Feed-back session in which issues are listed (5 minutes)</p></li><li><p>Full-group discussion of possible solutions to the more important issues (from 15 minutes to 45 minutes).</p></li></ul><p>If you have a project which needs to set basic ground-rules with respect to these data management issues, you might like to prepare a handout that can be given out at this point.</p><ul><li><p> naming files, so they are easily retrieved and can be grouped if necessary</p></li><li><p> how and where to save files, in electronic and paper copies </p></li><li><p> when to anonymise personal data in files</p></li><li><p> how to ensure security and privacy</p></li><li><p> when and where to carry out back-ups (and how to name these)</p></li><li><p> when to translate material into the project language (if necessary)</p></li></ul><p>Main issues we suggest should be considered here are:</p><p>Notes for facilitators:</p><p>Translation is often a big issue for projects that have limited resources. There is a <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/handout_on_issues_of_translation" title="handout on issues of translation">handout on issues of translation</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801384859648.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> used in the previous session which discusses some general principles. But in practice hard decisions may need to be taken about whether (or how much) to transcribe recorded interviews or focus group discussions; when (and how much) to translate; and who should translate, as well as what kinds of quality controls will be introduced to ensure the data are good enough for coding and eventual possible citation.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">Introduction to qualitative data analysis</span></h2><p>Time: Allow about 2-3 hours (half a day) for this part of the session. Many people find qualitative data analysis the hardest thing to understand, and the more they engage with practical examples, the better. </p><p>Preparation:  You’ll need a flip-chart, black- or white-board or computer plus projector for the brainstorm sessions.</p><p>You might want to bring in a couple of books with indexes, to show people the similarities between a familiar exercise – looking something up in an index – and basic descriptive coding.</p><p>A popular non-computer-based coding method is the‘cut and paste’ method. Here the researcher cuts and pastes quotes from interviews under various themes/topics on a big sheet or chart paper. Each chart paper denotes a single theme/topic and all the quotes from various interviewees can be arranged in columns. When reading across the sheets you can understand the variation in responses to a particular question or around a particular theme, and when reading down the sheet you see how an individual’s responses fit into a larger picture of their life). </p><p>If you have an example of your own, it would be worth bringing it in and talking participants through what you did. Alternatively, you could create an example, using invented quotes, cut and pasted onto large sheets of paper or card.</p><p>You’ll also need a sample (perhaps one page) from an interview transcript, fieldnotes or other form of qualitative data, one copy for each participant and an electronic version that can be shown on a projector to help in the feed-back session.</p><p>Process:</p><p>You can use the PowerPoint <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Presentation_on_Qualitative_Data_Analysis" title="Presentation on Qualitative Data Analysis">Presentation on Qualitative Data Analysis</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801406951424.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> as the basis for this session. We suggest that you break up the flow with a series of full-group brainstorms or small-group tasks. For example:</p><ul><li><p> Ask people what they see as the main differences and similarities between the analysis of quantitative and of qualitative data. </p></li><li><p> Draw on the experience of the group in making sense of unfamiliar places – noticing, collecting and thinking are processes we all use. </p></li><li><p> Use the sample extract as a basis for getting people to generate codes, and to think about the differences between descriptive and analytic codes.</p></li></ul><h2><span class="mw-headline">Basic introduction to the use of computers to help with qualitative data analysis</span></h2><p>Time: 45 minutes</p><p>Preparation:  This depends on whether you are training a group of researchers in an existing project or not, whether you have the need, desire (and funds) to use a software package, and if so, whether you have already selected and purchased a package that you want everyone to be familiar with. </p><p>But you’ll certainly need a flip-chart, black- or white-board or computer plus projector for the brainstorm sessions.</p><p>Process:</p><p>If you want to run this just as a general introduction to CAQDAS (Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software), we suggest you use the attached <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Presentation_on_CAQDAS" title="Presentation on CAQDAS">Presentation on CAQDAS</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801430429696.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> with worked examples from projects with which you are familiar.</p><p>There is a <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/Handout_on_CAQDAS" title="Handout on CAQDAS">Handout on CAQDAS</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801437249536.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/>: you could give this out at the end of this session</p><p>Additional Resources:</p><p>There is a comprehensive web-page that covers many issues with respect to different versions of qualitative data analysis:</p><p><a href="http://onlineqda.hud.ac.uk/Introduction/index.php" title="http://onlineqda.hud.ac.uk/Introduction/index.php">http://onlineqda.hud.ac.uk/Introduction/index.php</a></p><p>This site includes a summary statement comparing the various CAQDAS packages available in 2004, and links to other review pages:</p><p><a href="http://onlineqda.hud.ac.uk/Which_software/index.php" title="http://onlineqda.hud.ac.uk/Which_software/index.php">http://onlineqda.hud.ac.uk/Which_software/index.php</a></p><p>We are not recommending any particular CAQDAS package: to our minds, each has its strengths and weaknesses.

Ethical issues often shade into political ones, and there are also close links between ethical concerns and issues around participation. Ethical issues also shade into questions of trust: since 'the researcher is the research instrument' in some important ways, the reader and/or user of qualitative research needs to be able to trust the researcher to have followed the appropriate procedures. In each of the other sessions we have tried to highlight such concerns. But you may also want to devote a specific session to considering ethical issues. It would be easy to spend a half day on this topic, and not difficult to programme a full day's activities. Here we have restricted ourselves to an introduction to ethical issues in a relatively narrow sense, with suggestions for further readings later.</p><p>Time: 60-90 minutes</p><p>Objectives</p><p>To introduce participants to key ethical concerns in the design or a piece of qualitative research, and in the processes of data collection, data management, data analysis and publication, with particular reference to:</p><ul><li><p> What is informed consent? When is it essential, and how should it be gathered?</p></li><li><p> What are the benefits and costs of written consent forms, and when should they be used?</p></li><li><p> How to avoid harm to respondents</p></li><li><p> The uses of anonymising data and the maintenance of confidentiality</p></li><li><p> Reciprocity in research relationships</p></li><li><p> Reflexivity and ethics</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this session, participants should have reflected on the various dilemmas that may be encountered in the field and how to manage them -- and be aware that for many of these dilemmas there is no 'right' or simple solution.</p><p>Preparation</p><p>Handouts of all (or extracts from) relevant research council and professional association guidelines or ethical codes.

We discuss the consent process in the light of recently published guidelines, the experience of nutrition and health research projects, and the ethics review process of the Instituto de Investigación Nutricional with peri-urban and rural populations in Peru. We discuss the cultural context in relation to (i) who should be involved in the decision for participation, especially for research in children and in community settings; (ii) when to use written or verbal consent; (iii) the format and presentation of the consent form to ensure understanding by the target population; and (iv) the process of how and by whom information is given and consent is obtained. Common concerns of participants with regard to their involvement in research studies are presented, as well as aspects that participants find difficult to understand. Some specific concerns of conducting research with Indigenous Peoples are discussed. We recommend future research to further understand and implement informed consent processes to assure genuine and voluntary consent in different developing country contexts.</p><ul><li><p> Upvall, M (2001) Negotiating the informed-consent process in developing countries: a comparison of Swaziland and Pakistan International Nursing Review 8(3):188-192, September</p></li></ul><p>Abstract: Protecting the rights of research participants when conducting studies within an international context presents many challenges. The purpose of this article was to compare and contrast the process of obtaining informed consent in two very different countries - Swaziland and Pakistan. Major aspects of the informed-consent process presented included identification of gatekeepers, seeking permission from officials, negotiating with these officials and Institutional Review Board (IRB) committees in regard to the type of data to be collected, and explaining informed consent to participants in the field. Data for this article is based upon qualitative research of collaboration between nurses and healers in Swaziland and from a variety of studies completed in Pakistan. These studies demonstrate the inadequacy and complexity of applying western-based concepts of informed consent to developing countries.</p><ul><li><p> Riessman, C (2005) Exporting ethics: a narrative about narrative research in South India Health Vol. 9, No. 4, 473-490</p></li></ul><p>Abstract: The article notes some problems with the prepositional discourse of research ethics that is dominant in the West, and joins the call for an ethics-in-context approach in the human sciences. Using detailed examples from my fieldwork in South India to develop a narrative about ethical conflicts, I explore the problematics of informed consent, confidentiality and other concepts central to research ethics in the USA. The article underscores the inherent and practical risks associated with ethical universalism - applying ‘universal’ moral principles that have been constructed (that is, derived) in one cultural context and exporting them, without modifications, to another. The personal narrative includes my emotions in the field; they do moral work. The article draws theoretically from Bakhtin, Rabinow and feminist scholars of the Indian diaspora.</p><ul><li><p>Rashad A M, MacVane Phipps F, and Haith-Cooper M, (2004) Obtaining Informed Consent in an Egyptian Research Study Nursing Ethics Vol. 11, No. 4, 394-399</p></li></ul><p>Abstract: This article explores the concept of internationally acceptable codes of ethics within the context of an Egyptian nurse’s PhD studies. Theoretical work, including gaining ethical approval for the project, took place in the UK, while the data collection phase of the study was done in Egypt. This highlighted areas where the Arab Muslim interpretation of some ethical principles, especially around the issue of gaining informed consent, differed from that currently accepted in British research ethics. The authors argue that it may not be possible, or even desirable, to standardize codes of ethics globally in areas such as academic research. Ethical principles develop from a unique mix of culture and religion. It may be more important to develop cultural competence that includes the ability to understand and respect the way in which ethical principles are interpreted by various societies.</p><h1 class="firstHeading">Evaluation</h1><p>Evaluation of a workshop is an invaluable part of the learning process which provides insights for both the facilitators and participants. Evaluation can help achieve a range of different objectives:</p><ul><li><p>Help facilitators gauge how much participants have learned, and what areas are still to be covered</p></li><li><p>Help participants reflect on what they have learnt</p></li><li><p>Provide feedback from participants in order to improve future workshops</p></li><li><p>Create an opportunity to recognise and value everyone’s contribution</p></li><li><p>Close the session in a meaningful way, drawing together the key points, rather than ending in an abrupt or inconclusive manner</p></li></ul><p>There are two ways of encouraging evaluations:</p><ul><li><p>Quick evaluations at the end of the day (or these could be used at the beginning of the next day, though the immediacy factor is important), and </p></li><li><p>Detailed evaluation at the end of the workshop</p></li></ul><h2><span class="mw-headline">Quick evaluations at the end of each day</span></h2><p>At the end of the day, each person in turn (including the facilitator)</p><ul><li><p>Gives one word to express how s/he feels about the day’s events</p></li><li><p>Name one thing that you liked the most, and the one thing you least liked</p></li><li><p>Gives three adjectives to describe the atmosphere in the group</p></li></ul><p>Any one of the above options can be used per session. It would perhaps not be as useful to use all three in one instance.</p><p>This is also a good opportunity to ask participants to reflect on anything they may have written in their 'course diary' [See the 'Getting Started' Session]. Participants should be encouraged to make suggestions for the remaining days, in case the course is not going to meet some of their expectations.</p><p>Another method that worked well in some of our workshops was the 'post-it exercise'. On the wall we stuck a chart paper divided into two columns- ‘I wish to know’ and ‘I now know’. Participants were encouraged to leave post-its for others with any queries and/or questions. These were reviewed by participants on a daily basis and the post-it moved to its appropriate place.  </p><p> On all days, the facilitators are encouraged to end the day by thanking the whole group for their participation and contributions.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline">End of the workshop evaluation</span></h2><p>In our workshops we tended to use a paper-pencil method for this evaluation. This was particularly useful where it is considered inappropriate or disrespectful to criticize someone in person, even if done constructively. These paper-based evaluations provided participants a degree of anonymity which some found useful. You might find it useful to consider an <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=/example_of_the_evaluation_form" title="example of the evaluation form">example of the evaluation form</a> <img src="Pictures/12221243801590061056.png" class="image" title="" alt=""/> we used for these workshops. Another advantage of this method is that it is relatively easy to summarise responses, for example to send to funders (or to feedback to this web-site to help us improve the manual for future use.)</p><p>In addition to the paper-based method we have tried to supplement it with an open group discussion (on the themes identified in the paper-based questionnaire). These discussions cane be conducted by the participants in the absence of the facilitator(s) and one of them takes the responsibility of giving a collective feedback. </p><p>A more involving task can be a small group activity for the participants (an example of which is given below). </p><p>Activity based evaluation: 'Throw out or keep</p><p>Place a cardboard box with a hole cut into it in the middle of floor (with a sign stating 'scrap'). Give each participant four pieces of paper and ask them to write or draw anything they have experienced in the workshop that they would like to leave behind when they go home, and anything they would like to keep and take home with them. The thing(s) that they would like to throw out can be put in the 'scrap' box. Then ask them to share with the rest of the group the things(s) that they would like to keep. </p><p>We felt that all our participants valued an appreciation of their involvement. In most of the workshops we ended the session by giving each participant a certificate of attendance.</p><h1 class="firstHeading">Acknowledgements</h1><h2><span class="mw-headline">Acknowledgements </span></h2><p>This manual is the result of the work undertaken by a range of people.

We would also like to specifically acknowledge the contributions of Professor Madeline Arnot in developing the session on semi-structured interviews, and Dr. Sharlene Swartz’s (Human Sciences Research Council, South Africa) invaluable inputs in the session on using visual images in research. </p><p>Turning the manual from a hard copy that made sense to us (but not always to anyone else) and that we changed as we went along, into an electronic copy that tries to be clear, consistent and comprehensive, has taken more time and effort than we expected: we are immensely grateful to <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bjoern" title="Björn Haßler">Björn Haßler</a> and <a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=User:Arathi" title="Arathi Sriprakash">Arathi Sriprakash</a> for their good humour and enthusiasm in making this possible.</p><p><a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=User:Nidhi" title="Nidhi Singal">Nidhi Singal</a>, University of Cambridge</p><p><a href="http://manual.recoup.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/index.php?title=User:Roger" title="Roger Jeffery">Roger Jeffery</a>, University of Edinburgh</p><p>September 2008</p></div></div></body></html>
