The files in this catalog are:
wxtstyle.css:   A sample stylesheet that describes all styles produced by WXT
                You may of course edit this file to get the look you want.
wxtjs.js:       The javascript necessary for wxt,
                in addition to prototype.js at (http://www.prototypejs.org/)
The rest are image files used by the stylesheet. Again: redesign at will.
