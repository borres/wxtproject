<h1>Testing PI:ref and footnotes</h1>
 <h2>What?</h2>
<p>
    Running short of meaningfull text, I turn to some <?_wxt ixword word="latin" comment="quotes"?> quotes
    copied from <?_wxt ref id="latinquotes"?>. It may not be correct to use footnotes for translation,
    it may be "Ad absurdum"<span class="fn">To the point of absurdity</span>, but it looks fine.
    Like for instance "Extra ecclesiam nulla salus"
    <span class="fn">Outside the Church [there is] No Salvation. (A phrase of much disputed significance in Roman Catholic theology)</span>
    could be used in many situations outside the church.
</p>
<p>
 Or if ypu are a teacher you could of course tell your students "Aut disce aut discede"<span class="fn">Either learn or leave</span>,
 as you have always wanted.
