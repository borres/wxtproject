    wxt5 is etablished as a copy of wxt4
    Tidy is removed and jSoup is installed
    wxt5tests is established and versioned

----------------------------------------------
planning:
    - remove databaseimport and use database by command
    - introduce importthtml to handle html(5) directly
      should also cover wiki if we open up for cleaning of refs etc
      with possible use of CSSselector in jsoup doc
    - remove odt import completely (also formulas)
