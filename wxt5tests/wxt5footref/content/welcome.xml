<h2>Some text</h2>
<p>
 Whenever you read some text relating to computers and the WWW<span class="fn">World Wide Web</span>, 
 you find a lot of lingo<span class="fn">a characteristic language of a particular group</span>.
 Some examples are WYSIWYG<span class="fn">what you see is what you get</span>, 
 AJAX<span class="fn">Asynchronous JavaScript And XML</span> 
 and CAPTCHA<span class="fn">Completely Automated Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart. 
 More on Turing tests at The Alan Turing Home Page<?_wxt ref id="turing"?> or at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" class="external">Wikipedia</a></span>,
 inspired from the works of Alan Turing<?_wxt ref id="turing"?>.
 </p>

<p>
 Of course this lingo is usefull for precision and ease of discussion. We need some precision to
 discuss the differences and similarities between for instance MVC<span class="fn">Model View Controller</span>
 as introduced by Trygve Reenskaug<?_wxt ref id="reenskaug"?> and the more
 recently coined principle of SoC<span class="fn">Separation of Concerns</span>, Wikipedia
 has an introduction<?_wxt ref id="socw"?>. 
</p>
<p>
 On the other hand you sometimes get the feeling that the lingo serves the same purpose as 
 one can suspect that <?_wxt ixword word="latin" comment="with reference to medieval services"?> did in medieval services; To mystify more than to clearify.
</p>

 <p>Personally I think we should try to apply the KISS<span class="fn">Keep It Simple Stupid</span>-principle,
 in most situations of life.
