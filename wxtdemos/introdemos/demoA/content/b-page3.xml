<p>This is the content of page 3</p>
<p>Note that the source for this program is "generic" XML-page, while
 the source for <?_wxt xlink id="Page2"?> is a complete XHTML-page. Which to use is up to you,
 as long as it is wellformed. If you use an HTML-editor to prepare your pagecontent,
 you will use XHTML. On the other hand if you use a straight text editor, you may as well
 prepare "minimalistic" content.
