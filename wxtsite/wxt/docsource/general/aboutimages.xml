<h1>Images</h1>
<p>
 When you use illustrations in your material, you will normally do it the straight forward way
 by introducing <em>img</em>-tags. But WXT offers an option that makes it simple to
 administrate many images in a simple way.
</p>
<p>
 You may prepare one or more files that describes images, see <?_wxt xlink id="Images"?>,
 and use these images simply by using a image PI, see <?_wxt xlink id="PIimage"?>.
The image PI also lets you define images for reuse and imagelists "on the fly". 
</p>
<p>
 All defined images, either by an images-file or by an image PI, may be selected for imagelists, <?_wxt xlink id="PIimagelist"?>. 
 An imagelist  is a list of thumbe that may be expanded by mousenter.
</p>
<p>
An image file is validated according to the following scheme:
</p>
<div>
<?_wxt importtxt location="images.xsd" lang="lang-xml"?>
</div>
<p>
 The addresses , <em>location</em> - attribute of the images are supposed to be correct relative to the file.
 This may be changed by the <em>catalog</em> attribute in the root element images.
</p>
<p>
 A sample image file:
</p>
<div>
<?_wxt importtxt location="../script/samples/myimages.xml" lang="lang-xml"?>
</div>
