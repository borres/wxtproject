<h1>References</h1>
<p>
  You can manage references in WXT in may ways. 
  You can of course introduce a webreference anywhere as simple html (a-tag).
  In addition to that WXT has some mechanismes for reference handling.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crossrefs</strong> References within a site (as defined in a script), from module to module is best
 handled with an xlink, see <?_wxt xlink id="Xlink"?>. The PI takes a modules id as parameter
 and will work as long you have unique id for modules in the script. You may thus rename the module and/or 
 move it on your disk without breaking the link.
</li>
<li><strong>Demolink</strong> a demolink, see <?_wxt xlink id="Demolink"?>, is a general 
 PI that has been introduced  to produce a XHTML-fragment that links to any webpage, with any style. 
 Since the PI lets you control the styleclass, you may work with many categories of links, each with
 its own styling. 
</li>
<li><strong>General references</strong> This is the most ambitious referencehandling in WXT.
 It attempts to organize references of many types and display them in three basic forms: SIMPLE, IEEE and HARVARD.
 This referencehandling involves three steps: 
 <ul>
	 <li>One or more files with a description of all references you intend to use, <?_wxt xlink id="References"?>.
	 </li>
	 <li>a PI to display one reference in the running text,  <?_wxt xlink id="PIreference"?>.
	 </li>
	 <li>a PI to display reference lists, <?_wxt xlink id="PIreferencelist"?>.	 
	 </li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
 The schema for controlling reference files:
</p>

<div>
<?_wxt importtxt location="refs.xsd" lang="lang-xml"?>
</div>

<h2>A sample file</h2>
<div>
<?_wxt importtxt location="../script/samples/myrefs.xml" lang="lang-xml"?>
</div>
</body>
</html>
