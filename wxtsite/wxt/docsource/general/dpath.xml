<h1>DPATH</h1>
  <p>DPATH is introduced in this context as a means of addressing elements in a
  document with a flat structure. It has some resemblance with xpath, but is much simpler and 
  has less precision.
  </p>

  <p>The basic structure in an DPATH-expression is best considered as an
  analogy to a unix filepath. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Some examples:
  </p>
<table>
<tr>
    <td>//Results</td>
    <td>Will select all material under heading-level 3 with name Results </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>*</td>
    <td>Will attempt to select all material under headings level 1 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>/Semifinal/Results</td>
    <td>Will select all material under heading-level 3 with name Results which are under header-level 2 with name Semifinal </td>
</tr>

</table>



	<p>
	We may also have a spesification part, or selection part,  in the form []. 
	The purpose is to filter the elements we use. 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>[*] will have no filtering
	effect, all elements will be included. 
	</li>
	<li>[p,img] wil select only elements of type p and img.
	</li>
	
	</ul>

<table>
<tr>
    <td>//Results[*]</td>
    <td>Will select all material under heading-level 3 with name Results </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>//Results[table]</td>
    <td>Will select all elements of type table under heading-level 3 with name Results </td>
</tr>
</table>
