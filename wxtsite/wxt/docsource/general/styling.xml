<h1>Styling</h1>
<p>
  WXT produces some elements which are marked with <strong>class</strong>-attribute.
  You can, and should, control the appearance of these elements by defining the
  appropriate styles in a stylesheet.
</p>
<p>
    A basic stylesheet involving most actual styles are quoted below.
	This is distributed with WXT, see catalog usefull in the dist catalog.
</p>
<p>	
    This may not be the styling of your dreams, but it indicates the 
    possibilities. Remember that you can always surround any fragment with a div or span 
    that controls the styling.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Inspect</strong> the stylesheet to see which style elements you should define
    for each produced fragment, as resulting from PI commands.
