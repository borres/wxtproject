<h1>Script: pathfragment-element</h1>
<p>
  The purpose of a pathfragment is to define a path that can be used in other parts of the script,
  and in most processing instructions that has a location as attribute.  
  This is helpfull if we want to rearrange our filestructure.
  A pathfragment may be any part of a path.
  The definition-element may contain any number of pathfragments.
 </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang"><![CDATA[<pathfragmet id="" value=""/>]]></pre>

<table cellpadding="10px">
  <tr>
    <td  style="vertical-align:top"><strong>id</strong>(mandatory)</td>
    <td>Any string that will identify the pathfragment.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td  style="vertical-align:top"><strong>value</strong>(mandatory)</td>
    <td>Any string that is a legal part of an URI or a filepath.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td  style="vertical-align:top"><strong>alternative</strong>(optional)</td>
    <td>Any string that is a legal part of an URI or a filepath.
	If your script is used both on windows and an operating system with unix-like filepaths,
	you may use <em>value</em> and <em>alternative</em> to describe both alternatives. 
	WXT will select the one that is most likely to be matching the current operating system.
	(looking for cases like 'n:\' or '\' or '/'). 
	When <em>alternative</em> is not used, WXT does not discriminate between \ and /.

<p>The pathfragment  <em>_scriptcatalog</em> is predefined as 
  the filepath to the catalog containing the script</p>
<p>The pathfragment <em>_scripturi</em> is predefined as 
  the URI defining the script, as string</p>  
  <p>A pathfragment is treated "as is".</p>
  <p>Pathfragments are used like this: <em>${fragmentid}</em>, see for instance <?_wxt xlink id="Command"?></p>


<p>Examples:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><![CDATA[<pathfragment id="myroot" value="/mydir" />
<pathfragment id="antpath" 
              value="c:/fixed/apache-ant/bin" />
<pathfragment id="princepath" 
              value="c:/fixed/prince/Engine/bin" />
<pathfragment id="mydata" 
              value="c:\fixed\data\ "
              alternative="/home/fixed/data/" />]]>
